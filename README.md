# CZERTAINLY Keystore Entity Provider

> This repository is part of the commercial open-source project CZERTAINLY. You can find more information about the project at [CZERTAINLY](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY) repository, including the contribution guide.

Keystore Entity Provider `Connector` is the implementation of the following `Function Groups` and `Kinds`:

| Function Group    | Kind       |
|-------------------|------------|
| `Entity Provider` | `Keystore` |

Keystore Entity Provider implements automation of certificate management related tasks on the software keystore:
- JKS
- PKCS#12

It is compatible with the `Entity Ptovider` interface. This entity provider utilizes the SSH authorized connection with the servers and provider the location configuration of the keystores with access to generate and manipulate the content.

Keystore Entity Provider `Connector` allows you to perform the following operations:
- Register servers (with SSH access)
- Register keystore locations
- Publish certificate to the keystore
- Generate key pair and request certificate (CSR)
- Remove certificates (and keys) from the keystore
- Automatically renew certificates in the keystore

## Database requirements

Keystore Entity Provider `Connector` requires the PostgreSQL database to store the data.

## Short Process Description

Keystore Entity Provider `Connector` provides access to the keystore locations on the remote servers. Multiple locations on one server are supported. The `Connector` can create multiple `Entities` and automate the certificate lifecycle on associated locations.

The certificate operations are provided by the CZERTAINLY `Core` platform consistently across `Entity Providers`.

To know more about the `Core`, refer to [CZERTAINLY Core](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY-Core)

### `Entity` attributes

- Hostname / IP Address of the `Entity`
- Type of the authentication
- Credential

### `Location` attributes

The attributes for creating a new `Location` includes:
- Keystore Path
- Keystore Password
- Keystore Type
